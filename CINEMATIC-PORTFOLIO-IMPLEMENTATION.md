# Cinematic Dark Theme Portfolio Implementation

## üé¨ Overview
Successfully revamped the 'My Work' section with a cinematic dark theme featuring hover-to-play video cards, a responsive horizontal scroll layout, and sophisticated GSAP animations.

## üé® Visual Design Changes

### Cinematic Dark Theme
- **Background**: Solid black (`#000000`) for a seamless, immersive experience.
- **Accent Colors**: Crimson red (`#D50032`) used for primary highlights, glows, and interactive elements.
- **Typography**: Large, bold fonts with cinematic styling (`cinematic-title`) for high contrast and readability.
- **Film Effects**: A subtle `film-grain` overlay is applied to the section background to enhance the cinematic feel.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep black backgrounds to match the rest of the site.
- **Text**: White/off-white for maximum contrast.
- **Accents**: Crimson red (`#D50032`) for titles, borders, and focus states.
- **Borders**: Semi-transparent white with a red accent glow on hover.

## üé• Interactive Features

### Hover-to-Play Video Cards
- **Desktop**: A short, muted preview video automatically plays on loop when a user hovers over a project card. The video fades in smoothly over the poster image.
- **Mobile**: The hover-to-play functionality is disabled for performance. Static poster images are displayed instead.
- **Click Action**: The entire project card is a clickable link that opens the full project video on YouTube in a new tab.
- **Fallback**: Each card has a high-quality `poster` image that displays before the video loads and for browsers that do not support the video format.
- **Video Formats**: The implementation supports both MP4 and WebM video formats for broad browser compatibility.

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: The section features a horizontal scrolling "film reel" experience, powered by GSAP ScrollTrigger.
- **Mobile**: Projects are displayed in a traditional vertical stack for natural mobile scrolling.
- **Breakpoint**: Animations and layout switch at the 768px breakpoint using `gsap.matchMedia()`.

## üöÄ Animation Enhancements

### GSAP Animations
- **Entrance**: On desktop, cards animate in with a staggered fade, scale, and position transform as they scroll into view horizontally. On mobile, they fade and slide up vertically.
- **Hover**: Cards lift and scale up smoothly on hover. A cinematic red glow appears around the border, and the preview video begins playing.
- **Scroll**: The entire section is pinned on desktop, allowing the horizontal container to scroll while the main page remains fixed.

### Performance Optimizations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Animations prioritize CSS transforms (`translate`, `scale`) and `opacity` for smooth, hardware-accelerated performance.
- **Conditional Loading**: Responsive animations and the video hover effect are conditionally loaded based on screen size to optimize for mobile.
- **`will-change`**: This CSS property is applied to animated elements to inform the browser of upcoming transformations, further improving performance.

## üìÅ File Structure Updates

### Public Directories
- **/public/assets/videos/**: Contains the short, compressed MP4/WebM preview videos for the hover effect.
- **/public/assets/images/**: Contains the high-quality poster images used as fallbacks and initial card displays.

### Updated Components
- `src/components/projects-section.tsx`: Redesigned to implement the responsive horizontal/vertical scroll layout and GSAP animations.
- `src/components/project-card.tsx`: Updated with the hover-to-play video functionality and clickable link wrapping the entire card.
- `src/app/globals.css`: Styles for cinematic effects (`.film-grain`, `.cinematic-glow`, etc.) are centralized here.

## üìä Project Data Structure

### Enhanced Project Schema in `projects-section.tsx`
```typescript
{
  title: string;        // "Chocolate Symphony ‚Äì Cadbury Campaign"
  subtitle: string;     // "Cadbury | Lead Video Editor"
  description: string;  // Detailed case study (2-3 sentences)
  image: string;        // Fallback placeholder image (if poster fails)
  video: string;        // Path to the preview video (e.g., "/assets/videos/cadbury-preview.mp4")
  poster: string;       // Path to the poster image (e.g., "/assets/images/cadbury-poster.jpg")
  tags: string[];       // Skills/tools used
  aiHint: string;       // Hint for AI image generation tools
  youtubeUrl: string;   // The full YouTube link for the project
}
```

### 9 Featured Projects

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Desktop Experience
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Creates a cinematic film reel navigation feel.
- **Video Previews**: Engages users with auto-playing video previews on hover.
- **Parallax Effects**: Subtle background movement during scroll enhances depth.
- **Focus States**: Cinematic glow rings and accent borders provide clear visual feedback on interaction.

### Mobile Experience
- **Vertical Stack**: Ensures a natural and intuitive mobile scrolling behavior.
- **Touch Optimized**: The entire card is a large touch target, simplifying navigation.
- **Performance First**: Videos on hover are disabled to save bandwidth and battery on mobile devices.
- **Responsive Typography**: Text scales appropriately for smaller screens.

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus states and proper tab order are maintained.
- **Screen Readers**: Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h3>`, etc.) and ARIA labels are used where appropriate.
- **Reduced Motion**: While not explicitly implemented, the use of GSAP allows for future integration with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Fallback Content**: Poster images provide a complete experience even if videos fail to load or are unsupported.

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### CSS Classes Used
- `.film-grain`: Applies a subtle texture overlay to the section background.
- `.cinematic-glow`: Adds accent lighting effects on hover.
- `.cinematic-transition`: Ensures smooth property changes for animations.
- `.cinematic-title`: Provides a gradient text effect for main headings.

### GSAP Integration
- **ScrollTrigger**: Manages the horizontal pinning and scroll-based reveal animations.
- **Timeline**: Used within components for coordinating hover animations.
- **`matchMedia`**: Enables fully responsive animation control for desktop and mobile.
- **Context**: GSAP context is used for proper cleanup and to prevent memory leaks in React's lifecycle.

## üìã Next Steps

### Content Addition
1. **Optimize Videos**: Ensure all preview videos in `/public/assets/videos/` are compressed to under 2MB each for fast loading.
2. **Optimize Images**: Ensure all poster images in `/public/assets/images/` are optimized for the web.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify video playback and animations across major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
